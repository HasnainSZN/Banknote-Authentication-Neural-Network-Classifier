# Banknote-Authentication-Neural-Network-Classifier
This project implements a neural network model for the classification of banknotes into authentic and counterfeit categories based on four features extracted from images: variance, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy. The dataset consists of samples obtained by processing images of genuine and forged banknotes.
